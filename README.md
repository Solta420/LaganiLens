# Laganilens

NEPSE Stock Market Data Analysis and Prediction using Machine Learning

---

## 📌 Overview

Laganilens is an academic AI/ML project focused on acquiring historical **NEPSE (Nepal Stock Exchange)** data, preprocessing it, and applying machine learning techniques to analyze trends and make predictions.

The primary objective of this project is to understand the end-to-end pipeline of a real-world data science project, including data acquisition (web scraping / APIs), data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and model building using Nepali stock market data.

---

## 🚀 Objectives

* Learn web scraping and API-based data acquisition for NEPSE data
* Store and manage historical NEPSE stock market data
* Perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Apply machine learning models for trend analysis and price prediction
* Understand challenges and limitations of predicting the NEPSE market
* Understand limitations of stock market prediction

---

## 📊 Data Source

* Historical data sourced from **NEPSE (Nepal Stock Exchange)**
* Data acquired using web scraping techniques and/or third-party APIs
* Stored locally in CSV format for further processing
* Data may contain missing values, inconsistencies, or delays due to market conditions

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

* Linear Regression
* Moving Average
* (Extendable to LSTM, Random Forest, etc.)

**Evaluation Metrics:**

* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

---

## 📈 Results

* Visualization of historical price trends
* Model performance comparison
* Observations and insights based on results

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

* Stock market data is highly volatile
* Limited historical data affects accuracy
* Predictions should not be considered financial advice

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Integrate real-time market data
* Use advanced deep learning models
* Improve feature engineering
* Add interactive dashboards
